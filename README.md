## What is Atomic Bot?

Atomic Bot is the easiest way to run a personal AI assistant. It's a native desktop app — not a CLI tool, not a Docker container, not a browser extension. Download the installer, open it, and you're ready to go. No terminal. No Homebrew. No `npm install`. Everything you need is bundled inside.

It connects the best AI models to the tools and messengers you already use — without switching tabs, copying text, or juggling multiple apps. Pick your AI provider, and start chatting. Atomic Bot handles the rest: it reads your messages across Telegram, Slack, Discord, and more — and replies for you with the power of Claude, GPT, Gemini, or any model you choose.

## Why Atomic Bot?

| Problem                                        | Atomic Bot                                                                                |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| CLI tools need terminal, Homebrew, Node.js     | **Just download and run** — everything is bundled, zero dependencies                      |
| Switching between ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini tabs | **One app, all models** — switch with a click                                             |
| Copy-pasting AI answers into messengers        | **Auto-replies** across Telegram, Slack, Discord, and more                                |
| No access to your files, notes, calendar       | **Built-in skills** — Google Workspace, Notion, GitHub, Obsidian, Apple Notes & Reminders |
| Voice input requires extra tools               | **Built-in Whisper** — hold a button and talk, locally or via API                         |
| AI can't run commands on your machine          | **Embedded terminal** with exec approval — AI runs commands, you stay in control          |

### Embedded terminal

A full terminal lives inside Atomic Bot. Your AI can suggest and run shell commands — with your explicit approval every time. Allow once, always allow, or deny. You stay in control.

### Smart exec approval

When the AI wants to run a command, you see exactly what it plans to do. One click to approve, deny, or auto-approve that command pattern. Security by default, convenience by choice.

### Auto-updates

Atomic Bot keeps itself up to date. New version available? A banner appears, you click download, and restart when ready. Release notes included.

### Backup & restore

Export your entire configuration as a ZIP snapshot. Restore it on a new machine or after a reset — all your settings, keys, and skills come back instantly.

## Getting started

No terminal required. No package managers. No config files. Just three steps:

1. **Download** Atomic Bot from [atomicbot.ai](https://atomicbot.ai) — one file, nothing else to install
2. **Open** — drag to Applications (macOS) or run the installer (Windows). All runtimes are bundled
3. **Pick your AI and go** — choose a provider, enter your API key, start chatting

Want to connect messengers or enable skills? The app walks you through it with a built-in setup wizard.
